# Predicting Medical Insurance Charges using Machine Learning ðŸš€

## Problem Statement
Healthcare costs are a significant concern for individuals and insurance companies alike. Predicting medical insurance charges accurately can help individuals plan for expenses and assist insurance providers in pricing policies effectively.

## Solution Approach
Initially, I experimented with linear regression to predict medical insurance charges. However, I found that linear regression didn't capture the complexities of the data effectively. To address this, I switched to polynomial regression, which enabled the model to capture nonlinear relationships between the features and the target variable more accurately.

## Insights from the Data
- **Smoking Habits**: Smokers tend to incur higher insurance charges, highlighting the impact of lifestyle choices on healthcare costs.
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Obesity is associated with increased medical expenses, emphasizing the importance of preventive healthcare measures.
- **Regional Variations**: Individuals from the southeast region consistently pay higher charges, suggesting regional variations in healthcare costs.
- **Family Size**: Families with 2 or 3 dependent children face higher insurance charges, indicating the influence of family size on healthcare expenditures.
- **Age Trends**: Interestingly, young adults in the age range of 20-25 tend to pay higher charges compared to other age groups, possibly due to lifestyle factors or limited access to preventive care.

## Model Performance
The polynomial regression model achieved an impressive R-squared score of 0.81, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual insurance charges. This performance demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging machine learning techniques to gain insights into healthcare costs and inform decision-making processes for individuals and insurance providers.

## Key Takeaways
This project underscores the importance of leveraging machine learning to gain insights into healthcare costs and inform decision-making processes for individuals and insurance providers. By accurately predicting medical insurance charges, individuals can better plan for healthcare expenses, while insurance providers can price policies effectively and manage risk.
